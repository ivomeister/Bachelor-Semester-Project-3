# Integral attacks on the PRESENT block cipher with practical complexity
This repository is a file collection comprising my Bachelor Semester Project developed during Semester 3 at the University of Luxembourg (September 2022 - January 2023).

The project examines the vulnerability of the PRESENT block cipher to cryptanalytic attacks using integral cryptanalysis. For this purpose multiple Python programs are used to simulate such attacks with a gradually increasing number of PRESENT encryption rounds, aiming to assess their practical effectiveness.
